# Note on the legacy CLI
There seems to be quite some confusion about the legacy CLI. This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy react-native-cli first (npm uninstall -g react-native-cli), for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (npm i -g @react-native-community/cli or yarn global add @react-native-community/cli).
